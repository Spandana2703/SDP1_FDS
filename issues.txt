ISSUES:
Unable to choose target customers:
Decide the type of product you want to design and for whom.  
Find a niche or develop your strengths in specific areas rather than diversifying yourself in too many product lines and losing your focus.

Lack of innovation:
Why do customers need your product?  Find out what differentiates your product line so you can stand out.
Todayâ€™s market is flooded with a lot of designs, and consumers are confused what to choose
Show strengths in your products that set you apart from your competition.

Poor marketing:
You need to be branded where your customers will be, whether it is on social media, magazines, billboards

Design copy:
Lazy designers will copycat your design and sell it very cheap
