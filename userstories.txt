DESIGNER
As a application designer, I want our website to look elegant and attractive so that we will be able to attract more  customers by just having a glance of it . We want to be more careful and aware of errors and bugs at the time of login and in other cases and the website  must contain various option like  fabrics ,colors, tools, etc. to let the user create their designs with complete freedom and we want to add a feedback section where they can express how they feel using it and any modifications or changes to be made to make it user friendly. We also wanted to give an option where customers can add their design to our website, or they then even buy the design by having membership. 

USER
I want the website to be comfortable to use. I want it to be more user-friendly where I can just hand draw the designs and have various options to choose from starting from the fabric options to the color and fit of the dress. I want the website to be easily understood, as in many websites it is always a very time consuming process to understand the features and get started with it. I also want the website to be easily accessed from anywhere and also to have an option to be able to save the designs halfway and continue when and where required. I want to be able to make changes in the existing designs, improving them even in offline mode if possible. I also want my designs to be secure and have the patent rights if someone wants to use them as a reference. I want this website to be completely transparent for the designers and with more security.
